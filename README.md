The-Epistemic-Coin

The Epistemic Coin is a fun and simple coin-flipping game designed to illustrate a foundational principle of science: how evidence is collected to support a hypothesis. This game is part of a larger capstone project centered on epistemology. Many people struggle with effective epistemological reasoning. I wager that not only is it important to improve individuals epistemological frameworks, but is an ethical and moral duty for individuals to strive toward greater epistemological consistency and maturity.
